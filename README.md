# Text-Summarization
To create a text summarization page where users can paste text and receive a summary as output, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a web page: Create a basic HTML page with a text input field for users to paste their text and a button to initiate the summarization process. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this purpose.

2. Capture user input: Use JavaScript to capture the text entered by the user in the input field when the button is clicked.

3. Preprocess the text: Apply the necessary preprocessing steps to the user's input, such as removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing into sentences or words.

4. Calculate sentence importance: Use a summarization algorithm, such as TF-IDF or TextRank, to calculate the importance scores for each sentence in the preprocessed text.

5. Select the most important sentences: Sort the sentences based on their importance scores and select the top-ranked sentences. The number of sentences you choose will depend on the desired length of the summary.

6. Generate the summary: Combine the selected sentences to create a concise summary. You can concatenate the sentences or use more advanced techniques like sentence fusion or abstraction.

7. Display the summary: Use JavaScript to display the generated summary on the web page, either in a separate section or as an overlay on the original text.

8. Refine and improve: Continuously evaluate and refine your summarization algorithm to improve the quality of the summaries generated. You can gather user feedback and use it to fine-tune your system.
